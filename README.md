# Visual Transformer Implementation

After reading [The Illustrated Transformer](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) blog post, I needed to implement one myself in order to gain a better understanding of the model's architecture.
I replicated the code from another PyTorch implementation of ViT [here](https://github.com/FrancescoSaverioZuppichini/ViT).
